## How To Harden A Raspberry Pi

Here's a curated  some best practices how to secure a Raspberry Pi. We will also implement and enable the security features to make the Pi secure.

### Changing Default Password

Every Raspberry Pi that is running the Raspbian operating system has the default username *pi* and default password *raspberry*, which should be changed as soon as we boot up the Pi for the first time. If our Raspberry Pi is exposed to the internet and the default username and password has not been changed, then it becomes an easy target for hackers.

- Open Up A Terminal
- Type `sudo raspi-config` And Press Enter
- Select *Option 1*
- Enter New Password
- Re-Enter Password
- You're Done

### Changing The Username

All Raspberry Pis come with the default username *pi*, which should be changed to make it more secure. We create a new user and assign it all rights.

- Open Up A Terminal
- Type `sudo adduser brucewayne` And Press Enter
- Enter New Password
- Re-Enter Password
- Fill or Skip The Rest
- Enter *Y* When Prompted

Now, We Have Our User `brucewayne` Created. It's Time To Add It To The Group `sudo` By The following Command.
```
sudo adduser brucewayne sudo
```

### Deleting `pi` user

If You're Logged In As `pi` , Log In As Another User Before Proceeding Further. To delete the pi user, type the following:
```
sudo deluser pi
```
This command will delete the pi user but will leave the `home/pi` folder. If necessary, you can use the command below to remove the home folder for the `pi` user at the same time.
```
sudo deluser -remove-home pi
```
If You Directly Deleted User `pi` Without The `-remove-home` Tag And Are Stuck With The User's Home Directory, Run This Command.
```
sudo rm -r /home/pi
```

### Making `sudo` Require A Password

When a command is run with sudo as the prefix, then it’ll execute it with superuser privileges. By default, running a command with sudo doesn’t need a password, but this can cost dearly if a hacker gets access to Raspberry Pi and takes control of everything. To make sure that a password is required every time a command is run with superuser privileges, do the following.

- Open Up A Terminal
- Type `sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd` And Press Enter
- Replace All With `pi ALL=(ALL) PASSWD: ALL`
- Save The File And Reboot Your Pi

### No Services Are Running as `root`

### Disable SSH Login as `root`

### Setting Up A Firewall

### Fail2Ban

### Improving SSH Security

SSH is one of the most common techniques to access Raspberry Pi over the network and it becomes necessary to use if you want to make it secure.

#### Username And Password Security

Apart from having a strong password, we can allow and deny access to specific users. This can be done by making the following changes.

- Open Up A Terminal
- Type `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config` And Press Enter
- At The End of The File, Add `AllowUsers brucewayne` To Allow Access Via SSH
- Add Another Line `DenyUsers newguy` To Deny Access Via SSH
- Save The File And Reboot Your Pi

#### Key-Based Authentication

Using a public-private key pair for authenticating a client to an SSH server (Raspberry Pi), we can secure our Raspberry Pi from hackers. To enable key-based authentication, we first need to generate a public-private key pair using tools called PuTTYgen for Windows and ssh-keygen for Linux.
Note that **a key pair should be *generated by the client* and *not by Raspberry Pi***. For our purpose, we will use PuTTYgen for generating the key pair. Download PuTTY from [here](https://www.putty.org) and follow the following instructions.

On The Client Side :

- Open the puTTYgen client and click on Generate
- hover the mouse over the blank area to generate the key
- name the private key file `rpi_privkey.ppk`
- copy the whole thing from the text area and paste into a text file named `rpi_pubkey.txt`
- transfer the public key file `rpi_pubkey.txt` to the Pi's Desktop

On The Raspberry Pi :

- Open Up A Terminal And Run The Following Commands
- `cd /home/brucewayne`
- `mkdir .ssh`
- `cd .ssh`
- `sudo nano authorized_keys`
- `cp /home/brucewayne/Desktop/rpi_pubkey.txt /home/brucewayne/.ssh/authorized_keys`
Now, provide the required permissions for your pi user to access the files and folders. Run the following commands to set permissions:
- `chmod 700 ~/.ssh/`
- `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
Finally, we need to disable the password logins to avoid unauthorized access by editing the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file.
- `sudo nano etc/ssh/sshd_config`
- Look For `#PasswordAuthentication yes` And Replace With `PasswordAuthentication no`
- Restart Your Pi For The Changes To Take Effect
